in the given problem, following are the doubts

1) at one point the problem definition says, minumum 2 promotion type should be applied in order to calculate the order total
2) other side, the problem definition says, promotions are mutually exclusive meaning if one promotion is applied the other promotion will not apply
3) but in the test case, it applies all the eligible promotions meaning all three promotions at a time

---------------------------------------------------------
Solution: So i have gone as per the test case scenarios
----------------------------------------------------------

and I really wanted to go as per SOLID principles and also to apply the Decorator Pattern. 
But due to time concern, i had to violate things in the Price Calculator class. :(
